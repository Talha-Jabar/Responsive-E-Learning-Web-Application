                        To be honest , this was my first online class. I am looking forward to taking more online classes. The experience of this class has being nothing but positive. I thought the coarse outline/power point was extremely helpful. The homework, quizzes and test were reasonable.

                        If there was one thing that I would recommend to help the class it would be an accompanying audio lecture to the power points.  I feel like this would have cleared up some of the points that I had neglected to focus on.  Some food for thought, so thank you.

                        I really liked the flexibility of the course. It worked well with busy scheduling, and the expectations were clear. One draw back was that if you didn't understand a lab, or the data from the lab that was provided, it was difficult find the answers from the weblab.
